The project provides umbrella for two platform specific implementation of
MCPSC: multi-core and many-core (SCC).

These implementations (sub-modules) were generated as a part of Mr. Anuj Sharma's 
PhD titled "Efficient Algorithms and Architectures for Protein 3D Structure
Comparison" at the University of Athens.
